# BT Real Estate

This is a project where I first learnt how to use Django.
The project contains a website made with HTML, CSS & Bootstrap.
The idea was to make this website dynamic, and connect a PostgreSQL database to it.

&#x1F539; Planning to replace this project with another business case in 2021.
